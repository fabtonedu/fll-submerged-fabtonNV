🌊 Fabton NV – FLL Submerged Challenge (Hong Kong Championship)
[Live demo & innovation link – coming soon]

🧠 1. Innovation – DeepTone Underwater Research Robot
Our FIRST LEGO League Innovation entry, DeepTone, is an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) tackling real-world aquatic issues. The 1. Innovation folder includes:

AUVs – research on existing autonomous/submersible robotics

Our Prototype – concept sketches, LEGO/3D-print models

Professionals – advisory notes and expert feedback

Research Material – scientific studies and environmental data

Surveys – Forms – community feedback and validation efforts

Time Management – logs tracking progress and responsibilities

🔍 Why DeepTone matters
By integrating modular design, sensor tech, swarm ideas, and sustainability, DeepTone aims to map and monitor underwater habitats more efficiently. We open-sourced all materials for educational and collaborative purposes.

🤖 2. Robot Game – Strategy, Planning & Execution
In 2. Robot Game, you’ll find everything from strategy to implementation:

Path Diagrams – visual maps for each mission’s routes

Docs – run plans, scoring breakdowns, and mission objectives

Scripts – Scratch block-programming files using original LEGO software

Run1.png, Run2.png, … & Ru7.png – screenshots of the Scratch programs capturing mission logic and alignment routines

📈 Performance-driven approach
We organized mission sequences, optimized paths, and implemented fallback procedures. We rigorously logged mission runs—tracking completion times, error occurrences, and iterative improvements—to ensure robust performance under competition conditions.

🛠️ 3. Robot Design – Build & CAD Details
Our 3. Robot Design section showcases build-level innovations:

Building Instructions – step-by-step assembly guides

Renders – high-quality visuals of the final robot and attachments

Studio Files – LEGO Studio 2.0 models for accurate reconstruction

The result: a stable, modular robot design capable of fine manipulation—ideal for the submerged challenges of FLL missions.
